This is a generic skeleton project that can be used to quickly get a
new [cisagov](https://github.com/cisagov) GitHub project started.
This skeleton project contains [licensing information](LICENSE), as
well as [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com) and
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) configurations
appropriate for the major languages that we use.

In many cases you will instead want to use one of the more specific
skeleton projects derived from this one.

# 👋 Welcome to CISA's Collaborative Space for Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) #

We’re using [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/cisagov/cybersecurity-performance-goals/discussions) as a place to connect and engage in a critical conversations with other members in the community. We hope that you will:

- Ask questions if something doesn't make sense.
- Share your thoughts on existing, and ideas for future, cybersecuirty performance goals (CPGs).
- Engage with us and other community members on ideas and actions to update and improve future versions of the CPGs.
- Welcome others and maintain an open mind.

## Background ##

On July 28, 2021, the President signed a [National Security Memorandum on Improving Cybersecurity for Critical Infrastructure Control Systems](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/28/national-security-memorandum-on-improving-cybersecurity-for-critical-infrastructure-control-systems/). The National Security Memorandum (NSM) establishes a voluntary initiative intended to drive collaboration between the Federal Government and the critical infrastructure community to improve cybersecurity of control systems.   

The NSM Identifies the “need for baseline cybersecurity goals that are consistent across all critical infrastructure sectors, as well as a need for security controls for select critical infrastructure that is dependent on control systems.” It instructs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to lead the development of cross-sector cybersecurity performance goals as well as sector-specific cybersecurity performance goals.  

The CPGs were developed based on CISA’s operational data, widely published research on the current threat landscape, and collaboration with industry groups, and private sector experts. NIST provided feedback and guidance on the draft CPGs which was incorporated into the final CPGs document. While the CPGs were developed with critical infrastructure in mind, they are more broadly useful for other organizations as well. Organizations of all sizes can use the CPGs to prioritize which security goals reduce the most risk to their environment and enable more prudent decision-making on allocation of resources toward specific security practices. It is intended to provide “clear guidance to owners and operators about cybersecurity practices and postures that the American people can trust and should expect for such essential services” to protect systems supporting National Critical Functions.
