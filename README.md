We‚Äôre using [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/cisagov/cybersecurity-performance-goals/discussions)
as a place to connect and engage in critical conversations with other members
in the community. We hope that you will:

- Ask questions if something doesn't make sense.
- Share your thoughts on existing, and ideas for future, cybersecurity
  performance goals (CPGs).
- Engage with us and other community members on ideas and actions to update and
  improve future versions of the CPGs.

## Background ##

On July 28, 2021, the President signed a
[National Security Memorandum on Improving Cybersecurity for Critical
Infrastructure Control Systems](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/28/national-security-memorandum-on-improving-cybersecurity-for-critical-infrastructure-control-systems/).
The National Security Memorandum (NSM) establishes a voluntary initiative
intended to drive collaboration between the Federal Government and the critical
infrastructure community to improve cybersecurity of control systems.

The NSM identifies the ‚Äúneed for baseline cybersecurity goals that are
consistent across all critical infrastructure sectors, as well as a need for
security controls for select critical infrastructure that is dependent on
control systems.‚Äù It instructs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to
lead the development of cross-sector cybersecurity performance goals as well as
sector-specific cybersecurity performance goals.

The CPGs were developed based on CISA‚Äôs operational data, widely published
research on the current threat landscape, and collaboration with industry
groups, and private sector experts. While the CPGs
were developed with critical infrastructure in mind, they are more broadly
useful for other organizations as well. Organizations of all sizes can use the
CPGs to prioritize which security goals reduce the most risk to their
environment and enable more prudent decision-making on allocation of resources
toward specific security practices. It is intended to provide ‚Äúclear guidance
to owners and operators about cybersecurity practices and postures that the
American people can trust and should expect for such essential services‚Äù to
protect systems supporting National Critical Functions.
